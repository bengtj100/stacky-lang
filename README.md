# Stacky - A simple stack language

**Welcome to the home of the *Stacky* programming language!**

## Introduction

**NOTE:** This is very much in alpha state! Things will change and may break compatibility before v1.0! **Do not use in production environments!**

*Stacky* is a small, but quite expressive stack-based programming language that also incorporates some of the features of the Lisp family of languages.

It is intended to be small and simple to implement and write code in, and should be suitable as a high-level programming language for small computer systems, such as single-board computers and micro-controllers.

The reference implementation is an interpreter, but there should be nothing that prevents a compiler to be implemented in the future.

## Documentation

Installation and building instructions are available in the [installation guide](https://github.com/bengtj100/stacky-lang/blob/main/doc/Installation.md).

An introduction to using the Stacky interpreter, as well as a short tutorial is available in the [introductory guide](https://github.com/bengtj100/stacky-lang/blob/main/doc/Introduction.md).

There is also a [reference manual](https://github.com/bengtj100/stacky-lang/blob/main/doc/Reference.md) as well as a documented [prelude](https://github.com/bengtj100/stacky-lang/blob/main/prelude/Prelude.sy) (a a library of standard operations written in Stacky it self.

There is also a list of known build and run-time [dependencies](https://github.com/bengtj100/stacky-lang/blob/main/DEPENDENCIES.md) to this project.
